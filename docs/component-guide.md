# Component Guide

## UI Components
Each UI component follows the same pattern:
- HTML structure in index.html
- Styling in css/components/[component].css
- Functionality in js/components/[component].js

## Game Components
Game mechanics are divided into logical components:
- Character control system
- Collision detection
- Environment interaction
- Physics calculations (simplified)

## Adding New Components
1. Create necessary files following naming conventions
2. Register component in main.js if needed
3. Connect to existing systems through defined interfaces
4. Document component purpose and integration points
