# Frontend Guideline Document for Cockroach Run

This document outlines the overall frontend setup for Cockroach Run – an immersive 3D web-based game with a dark, cyberpunk aesthetic designed for both desktop and mobile browsers. It describes our approach to architecture, design principles, styling, components, state management, routing, performance, and testing. The goal is to create a clear, modular, and maintainable experience that can scale as the game evolves.

## Frontend Architecture

Our frontend is built with modularity and performance in mind, using a combination of modern web technologies:

*   **3D Rendering:** Powered by Three.js and WebGL, our game scenes are rendered in immersive 3D. We also leverage React Three Fiber as a bridge between React and Three.js to help manage 3D elements in a familiar component-based way.
*   **UI Development:** Custom HTML and CSS lay the foundation for our user interface. We consider using Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling if it helps speed up prototyping and maintain consistency.
*   **Programming Languages:** We primarily use JavaScript, with a potential move to TypeScript for additional type safety and clearer code documentation.
*   **State Management:** A robust state management pattern is in place (using tools like Redux or Context API), ensuring that dynamic and shared elements, such as game progress, UI toggles, and wallet integration states, are handled efficiently.
*   **Component-Based Approach:** Emphasis is placed on creating self-contained components that can be easily reused and updated. This modularity allows us to add new game modes, environments, or UI screens without disrupting the core structure.
*   **Other Technologies:** The setup also includes Cannon.js for physics, Howler.js for audio, and GSAP with Lottie for animations. The use of Web Workers is considered to offload intensive calculations, ensuring smooth gameplay.

This architecture is chosen to support scalability, maintainability, and performance. The clear separation of concerns makes it easier to update the game, whether adding a new environment or integrating wallet features, and ensures a responsive experience across devices.

## Design Principles

The development is guided by several core design principles:

*   **Usability:** The interface is designed to be intuitive, with clear navigation and a logical layout that doesn't overwhelm players. Buttons, menus, and other interactive elements are designed with feedback to ensure users know exactly what is happening.
*   **Accessibility:** Despite the rich, immersive experience, the design adheres to accessibility standards to support players of varying abilities. This includes keyboard navigation where applicable and clear, distinct visual cues.
*   **Responsiveness:** The game UI and 3D environment are optimized for both desktop and mobile devices. Touch controls, adaptive performance modes, and responsive layout strategies ensure a consistent experience regardless of display size.
*   **Consistency:** A uniform style guides the creation of every screen, from menus to in-game HUDs, ensuring that users enjoy a seamless experience throughout the game.

## Styling and Theming

Our styling approach is key to establishing the game's immersive cyberpunk vibe:

*   **CSS Methodologies:** We are using modular CSS practices, employing approaches such as BEM (Block Element Modifier) to help keep our styles organized and scalable. Tailwind CSS might be leveraged for its utility classes to speed up development time.

*   **Visual Style:** The overall style can be described as modern, cyberpunk-inspired with elements of glassmorphism and subtle glitch animations. Angular, geometric shapes in UI elements and bordered containers with a soft glow capture this aesthetic.

*   **Color Palette:**

    *   Neon Green (#00FF66) is used for highlights and important UI elements.
    *   Purple (#9333EA) serves as a strong accent and interactive element color.
    *   Deep Black (#121212) forms the base background color, accentuating the neon details.
    *   Light Gray (#E0E0E0) is used for standard text, offering contrast against dark backgrounds.

*   **Typography:**

    *   Headings are styled using Orbitron — a bold, uppercase font that fits the futuristic theme.
    *   Body text is set in Exo 2, providing readability while complementing the overall design.

*   **Theming:** Theming is managed globally via configuration files or a dedicated theming provider. This setup ensures that any changes to the palette, fonts, or other stylistic aspects are applied uniformly across all UI components.

## Component Structure

We rely on a component-based architecture which makes our frontend highly maintainable and scalable:

*   **Organization:** All UI elements, screens, and even 3D scene controls are broken down into smaller, reusable components.
*   **Reusability:** Elements such as buttons, menus, and HUD components are designed to be reusable. This means if a change is needed, it can be done in one place and applied everywhere.
*   **Modularity:** Beyond static UI components, our dynamic game elements and screens such as the loading screen, start menu, and character selection flow are built as separate modules. This enables us to add or update features with minimal conflict across other components.

## State Management

Smooth gameplay and secure handling of game progress and wallet integration require robust state management:

*   **Approach:** We use a centralized state management system (like Redux or Context API) to track and share state across components. This includes user settings, game progress stored in local storage, and dynamic states such as wallet connection status.
*   **Benefits:** The state management approach ensures that changes are predictable and that the UI updates correctly in response to user actions, leading to a fluid user experience.

## Routing and Navigation

While our interface is highly interactive and component-driven, clear routing and navigation structures are also important:

*   **Routing Libraries:** If we decide to use React for the UI, React Router will manage different views such as the start menu, gameplay HUD, settings, and credits.
*   **Navigation Structure:** Users move seamlessly between game modes (Free Exploration, Endless Runner, and the exclusive Crypto Collector mode). Each section of the application is designed as an independent route that fits within the overall layout, ensuring a coherent navigation experience.

## Performance Optimization

Several strategies are implemented to ensure that Cockroach Run runs smoothly:

*   **Lazy Loading & Code Splitting:** Assets, including 3D models and audio files, are dynamically loaded to minimize initial load times.
*   **CDN & Asset Management:** Assets are hosted on a CDN with versioned URLs to improve load times and caching capabilities. This approach, combined with progressive loading and asset bundling, reduces latency.
*   **Responsive Performance:** Adjustments such as dynamic Level of Detail (LOD) for mobile and offloading intensive tasks to Web Workers ensure that performance is optimized across devices.
*   **Optimization Tools:** Tools and techniques like code minification, compression (glTF, WebP, MP3), and proper caching strategies are used to further enhance performance.

## Testing and Quality Assurance

To maintain a high quality frontend, our testing strategy includes:

*   **Unit Tests:** Utilizing Jest to cover individual components and utilities.
*   **Integration Tests:** To ensure that components interact correctly, integration tests are performed.
*   **End-to-End Tests:** Playwright covers full user interaction scenarios, ensuring a seamless experience from start to finish.
*   **Continuous Testing:** Automated tests run as part of our development pipeline, catching issues early and ensuring that new additions do not affect existing functionality.

## Conclusion and Overall Frontend Summary

To recap, Cockroach Run's frontend is built on a strong, modular architecture that uses modern web technologies to deliver an immersive 3D gaming experience.
