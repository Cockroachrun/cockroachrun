# Cockroach Run - App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

The game begins with a loading screen that welcomes every new and returning user as soon as they launch the game in their web browser. The loading screen is designed to engage the user visually with neon accents and dynamic progress updates, giving clear feedback about asset loading. Once loading is complete, the user is taken to the start menu where they see options to start the game, access settings, view credits, or connect a cryptocurrency wallet. Although there is no traditional registration or sign-up process with username and password for playing the game, users are offered options for saving their progress by either linking their cryptocurrency wallet or using a cloud backup option through an email-based account system. Users who connect their wallet automatically get premium features while local progress is stored in the browser. There is also a simple recovery process embedded in the email-based account option to help return players recover their game progress if needed.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After the initial onboarding, the start menu serves as the main dashboard from which the user navigates the game. The dashboard is designed with a dark, cyberpunk aesthetic that includes neon green highlights and purple accents. This screen is clean, intuitive and periodically animated with glitch effects to provide a futuristic vibe. From this page, the player chooses to start game modes, adjust the settings, check credits, or even integrate a cryptocurrency wallet. The interface layout is balanced with a header that displays the game logo and stylish cues, and with clearly marked interactive options that guide the player to the next stage of the experience.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

When a player selects the option to start the game from the start menu, they are brought to the mode selection screen. This screen presents the two core modes: Free Runner for a leisurely exploration of varied environments like kitchens, streets, bathrooms, and sewers, and Roach Runner for those who are looking for a fast-paced endless runner challenge. With smooth animated transitions that carry over the neon and glitch aesthetic, the user seamlessly chooses their mode. After settling on a game mode, the next transition takes the player to the character selection screen. Here, they view a range of cockroach characters, each with unique abilities such as temporary invisibility or enhanced jumping. Premium characters with exclusive effects become available if a cryptocurrency wallet is connected. Once a character is chosen, the gameplay screen is loaded, presenting an immersive 3D environment rendered with Three.js. The gameplay view overlays a HUD which shows scores, abilities, and progress. As the game proceeds, users can use intuitive controls adapted for either desktop or mobile devices. In gameplay, players can bring up a pause screen with a simple on-screen command, allowing access to a settings panel or simply to take a breather. In addition, when a game session ends, a game over screen appears that offers options to restart, view high scores, or return to the start menu. Each transition between screens and gameplay states is designed to be smooth and in line with the cyberpunk theme with subtle animations and visual effects.

## Settings and Account Management

Inside the game, account management and settings are integrated into multiple parts of the user journey. The settings screen can be accessed from both the main start menu and the in-game pause screen. Here users can adjust audio levels for background music, sound effects, and master volume. There are also options to change graphics settings, tweak performance options especially for mobile devices, and update control configurations such as touch sensitivity and device tilt options. For players who want to maintain a cross-device gaming experience, the system offers an optional cloud backup via email account creation, alongside linking with a cryptocurrency wallet to save exclusive achievements and unlock special characters. After making changes in the settings or managing account information, users can easily return to the main dashboard or seamlessly jump back into the current game session with a smooth transition that maintains the aesthetic and state of the game.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

The application is designed to handle various error states with clear and helpful messaging. If the game fails to load a specific asset from the CDN, the loading screen displays a fallback animation and loads a low-resolution version to ensure that gameplay is not disrupted. If a user enters an incorrect account recovery detail or fails to connect their cryptocurrency wallet properly, the system provides friendly error messages that explain the problem and offer a chance to retry the process. Network connectivity issues during gameplay trigger on-screen alerts informing the user that some features, such as leaderboards or community functions, may be temporarily unavailable, yet the core gameplay continues to operate offline. In absence of server connectivity, the game gracefully falls back to a state where local storage maintains game progress, ensuring that the player can resume the adventure without losing their achievements. The error handling is consistent, ensuring that regardless of which screen the player is on, the error messages match the overall cyberpunk design and provide clear pathways back to normal gameplay.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

The entire journey in Cockroach Run starts with an engaging and visually rich loading screen, progresses into a sleek main start menu that acts as a central hub, and guides the player through mode and character selections with an emphasis on seamless transitions. Whether choosing the free exploration mode for a relaxed experience or the endless runner mode for a more challenging session, every page is connected with thoughtful design and clear interactive cues. The integrated settings and account management options ensure that players have complete control over their experience, while error handling and fallback mechanisms protect the gameplay even in the face of connectivity or asset loading issues. The optional cryptocurrency wallet integration provides an extra layer of premium features and community engagement, making each session a blend of futuristic game mechanics and sleek cyberpunk design. Overall, Cockroach Run provides a complete and immersive journey from the moment a user first loads the game until they finish a session, with every screen and user action thoughtfully connected to create a cohesive and exciting experience.
