# Security Guidelines for Cockroach Run

Cockroach Run is an immersive 3D web-based game that integrates a cutting-edge cyberpunk aesthetic with modern web technologies and blockchain-based premium features. This document outlines comprehensive security guidelines that must be integrated into every phase of development and deployment to ensure the application is secure, resilient, and trustworthy by design.

## 1. General Security Principles

*   **Security by Design:** Incorporate security measures from the very beginning—design, implementation, testing, and deployment.
*   **Least Privilege:** Ensure that every component, user, and service is granted only the permissions required for its function.
*   **Defense in Depth:** Use multiple layers of security (network, application, and data layers) so that if one defense fails, others will still protect the system.
*   **Fail Securely:** Ensure that failures or exceptions lead to secure states, avoiding the inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information.
*   **Simplicity:** Opt for clear, simple security controls to avoid complex configurations which might be misconfigured or exploited.
*   **Secure Defaults:** Configure all systems with safe default settings out-of-the-box.

## 2. Authentication & Access Control

*   **Robust Authentication:**

    *   Implement strong authentication mechanisms for all endpoints, especially those involving sensitive wallet integrations and premium features.
    *   Enforce strong password policies (when applicable) with complexity, length, and secure hashing (using packages like bcrypt or Argon2).

*   **Session Management:**

    *   Utilize secure, unpredictable session tokens with appropriate expiration and regeneration policies to avoid fixation.
    *   Enforce server-side session validation for every sensitive action.

*   **JWT Best Practices (if employed):**

    *   Use robust algorithms (e.g., RS256 or HS256) and explicitly check token expiration times.
    *   Validate tokens thoroughly to prevent unauthorized access.

*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**

    *   Consider MFA options for premium wallet-connected users to add an extra layer of security, especially for actions that unlock exclusive content.

*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**

    *   Clearly distinguish between regular gameplay actions and premium wallet-based features, ensuring servers enforce strict role controls and permissions.

## 3. Input Handling & Processing

*   **Injection Prevention:**

    *   Use parameterized queries and prepared statements to guard against SQL/NoSQL injections.
    *   Sanitize all external input, whether from user interactions, external APIs, or uploaded files.

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Mitigation:**

    *   Apply context-specific output encoding for any data rendered on the client side.
    *   Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to block unwanted sources of executable scripts or styles.

*   **File Uploads & Redirects:**

    *   Validate files (checking type, size, content) and ensure they are stored securely outside the web root when applicable.
    *   Use allow-lists to validate redirect and forwarding targets, preventing unintentional exposure.

*   **Server-Side Validation:**

    *   Always enforce input validation on the server side, never rely solely on client-side controls.

## 4. Data Protection & Privacy

*   **Encryption:**

    *   Encrypt sensitive data both in transit (using TLS 1.2 or higher) and at rest (using AES-256 or similar standards).
    *   Ensure that any wallet-related or PII data is encrypted and safeguarded.

*   **Secret Management:**

    *   Do not hardcode secrets, API keys, or wallet credentials. Use secret management services like AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault.

*   **Minimizing Data Exposure:**

    *   Restrict error messaging and logging from revealing detailed system information. Ensure logs are stored securely, and sensitive data is obfuscated.

## 5. API & Service Security

*   **Secure Communications:**

    *   Mandate HTTPS for all client-server communications. Avoid any unencrypted endpoints.

*   **Rate Limiting & Throttling:**

    *   Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to counter brute-force attacks and denial of service attempts.

*   **CORS Configuration:**

    *   Configure CORS policies to allow only trusted origins and minimize the attack surface from cross-origin requests.

*   **Endpoint Protection:**

    *   Enforce strict authentication and authorization on all API endpoints, particularly those exposing services like leaderboards, NFT verification, and wallet integration.

*   **Data Minimization:**

    *   Design API responses to include only the necessary data required for each operation, reducing risk if intercepted.

## 6. Web Application Security

*   **CSRF Protection:**

    *   Include anti-CSRF tokens for any state-changing operations to prevent cross-site request forgery.

*   **Security Headers:**

    *   Set HTTP headers effectively:

        *   **Content-Security-Policy (CSP):** Restrict script sources, inline scripts, and external assets.
        *   **Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS):** Enforce HTTPS usage for all communications.
        *   **X-Content-Type-Options:** Prevent MIME-sniffing.
        *   **X-Frame-Options:** Prevent clickjacking by denying framing from unauthorized sites.
        *   **Referrer-Policy:** Control the amount of referrer information sent with requests.

*   **Cookie Security:**

    *   Mark cookies as `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and set the `SameSite` attribute appropriately to reduce the risk of session hijacking.

*   **Client-side Data Management:**

    *   Avoid storing sensitive data in localStorage or sessionStorage unless absolutely necessary and ensure any stored data is validated upon retrieval.

## 7. Infrastructure & Configuration Management

*   **Server Hardening:**

    *   Lock down server configurations by disabling unnecessary services, ports, and default accounts.
    *   Regularly update server software, operating systems, and any used libraries to their latest, patched versions.

*   **TLS/SSL Best Practices:**

    *   Configure strong cipher suites and disable obsolete protocols (SSLv3, TLS 1.0/1.1).

*   **File & Service Permissions:**

    *   Ensure that file system permissions are restrictive and only necessary ports and services are exposed to the public network.

*   **Debug Mode:**

    *   Disable debugging features and verbose error messages in production environments to limit information leakage.

## 8. Dependency Management

*   **Trusted Libraries:**

    *   Carefully select and review all third-party libraries and frameworks (e.g., Three.js, Tailwind CSS, GSAP, Cannon.js, Howler.js, etc.) to ensure they meet security standards.

*   **Vulnerability Scanning:**

    *   Use Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to monitor dependencies for known vulnerabilities.

*   **Lockfile Usage:**

    *   Use package lockfiles (e.g., package-lock.json, yarn.lock) to ensure controlled, deterministic builds and prevent unauthorized dependency updates.

## 9. Specific Considerations for Cockroach Run

*   **Cryptocurrency Wallet Integration:**

    *   Securely implement wallet integrations (supporting Xverse and Magic Eden) by verifying signatures and properly managing wallet data.
    *   Permit premium features and exclusive content only after validating Ordinals ownership without exposing sensitive wallet details.

*   **Mobile & Desktop Adaptations:**

    *   Ensure that responsive design and dynamic asset loading do not compromise security controls. Validate touch input and performance adaptations without introducing vulnerabilities.

*   **Modular Code Architecture:**

    *   Develop components with clear separations of concerns, allowing robust, independent security controls within the 3D rendering, UI system, and backend services.

*   **Asset Loading:**

    *   Use integrity checks and appropriate compression (e.g., SRI for CDN assets) to ensure loaded assets have not been tampered with.

## 10. Testing, Monitoring & Maintenance

*   **Security Testing:**

    *   Implement automated tests (using frameworks such as Jest and Playwright) to identify security flaws, combined with regular manual reviews.

*   **Real-Time Monitoring:**

    *   Deploy logging, intrusion detection systems, and monitoring tools to capture and alert on potential security breaches or unauthorized activities.

*   **Regular Audits:**

    *   Conduct periodic security audits and code reviews to ensure that security practices remain effective as the project evolves.

*   **Incident Response:**

    *   Develop an incident response plan to promptly and effectively remediate any security incidents.
