# Project Requirements Document (PRD) for Cockroach Run

## 1. Project Overview

Cockroach Run is an immersive 3D web-based game that brings a unique cyberpunk twist to casual gaming. Using Three.js and modern web technologies, the game combines an immersive 3D cockroach simulation with two distinct modes: a free exploration mode where players roam through varied environments, and an endless runner mode where the pace and intensity increase over time. The game’s dark, neon-accented aesthetic is designed to appeal to both casual gamers and cryptocurrency enthusiasts, thanks to an optional cryptocurrency wallet integration that unlocks premium in-game content.

The project is being built to innovate within the Web3 gaming space by blending classic game mechanics with modern blockchain features. The key objectives are to deliver a visually engaging and responsive gaming experience on both desktop and mobile platforms, and to provide exclusive in-game benefits to users who connect with a Bitcoin Ordinals wallet. Success will be measured by smooth gameplay, attractive aesthetics that maintain a consistent cyberpunk look, robust performance across devices, and a seamless integration of premium, wallet-based features that create additional value for the player.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**

*   Development of a 3D web-based game using Three.js and WebGL for immersive environments (kitchen, street, bathroom, sewer).
*   Two primary game modes: Free Runner (exploration) and Roach Runner (endless runner).
*   A character system featuring multiple cockroach types with unique abilities.
*   A custom HTML/CSS UI system, potentially enhanced with Tailwind CSS, including a loading screen, start menu, mode selection, character selection, in-game HUD, settings, and credits.
*   Asset management system that supports dynamic loading from a CDN with progress tracking and fallback mechanisms.
*   Centralized game state management system with localStorage support and optional cloud backup for user account integration.
*   Integrations for a cryptocurrency wallet (supporting Xverse and Magic Eden) to unlock premium characters, exclusive game modes, achievement NFTs, and community features.
*   Lightweight backend services (using serverless options like Firebase or AWS Lambda) for leaderboard tracking, Ordinals verification, achievement tracking, and analytics.
*   Implementation of responsive design principles and touch/keyboard input adaptations for both desktop and mobile platforms.
*   Cyberpunk-inspired UI design following specific guidelines (neon green, purple, deep black, Orbitron and Exo 2 fonts, glitch animations).

**Out-of-Scope:**

*   Full-scale multiplayer or real-time social interactions beyond basic leaderboard and community features.
*   In-app purchases or traditional microtransaction systems (the game follows a freemium model with wallet integration).
*   Development of non-essential or unrelated game modes beyond what is specified.
*   Expansions of the game world, new environments, or additional game modes beyond the initial release (future updates may include new plugin mechanics).
*   Advanced AI behaviors or extremely complex physics simulations beyond the planned integration of libraries such as Cannon.js.

## 3. User Flow

When a user first opens Cockroach Run in their web browser, they are greeted by an engaging loading screen that visually represents the progress of asset preloading. The loading screen is designed using dark backgrounds with neon accents, reflecting the cyberpunk aesthetic. Once the necessary assets have loaded, the user is taken to the start menu where they see clearly defined options such as starting the game, accessing settings, viewing credits, or optionally connecting a cryptocurrency wallet.

From the start menu, the user proceeds to the mode selection screen to choose between the free exploration mode and the endless runner mode. After selecting a game mode, the user is directed to the character selection screen, where various cockroach characters with unique abilities are presented—some only available via wallet-based premium features. Following character selection, the user enters the gameplay environment that features a dynamic HUD showing scores, abilities, and in-game progress, suitable for both keyboard and touch inputs. If needed, players can pause the game to access settings, view achievements, or return to the main menu, and upon game completion, they are presented with a game over screen that allows them to restart or view high scores.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance:**

    *   Smooth runtime performance on both desktop and mobile devices, implementing adaptive performance techniques (e.g., dynamic LOD adjustments).
    *   Target asset load times should be minimized through intelligent preloading and caching strategies.

*   **Security:**

    *   Secure wallet integration with verification of Ordinals ownership without unnecessary exposure of user data.
    *   Backend APIs should use proper authentication and rate limiting to avoid abuse.

*   **Compliance & Usability:**

    *   Responsive design ensuring usability across various screen sizes and orientations.
    *   Accessibility considerations on UI elements (readable font sizes, contrast levels) to accommodate a wider audience.
    *   Local storage and optional cloud-based backups for game progress in adherence with modern web standards.

*   **Reliability:**

    *   Robust error handling in the asset loading system and fallback mechanisms in case of asset loading failures.
    *   Minimal latency in audio triggers and game state updates during gameplay.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

*   The project assumes stable support for Three.js and WebGL across popular web browsers (desktop and mobile).
*   Reliance on third-party services (e.g., CDN, wallet API providers, Firebase/AWS Lambda) means availability and rate-limiting policies must be considered.
*   The component-based system needs to be flexible enough to support rapid future expansions, but initial release will focus on the core game modes and environments described.
*   It is assumed that the user's chosen development environment has access to VS Code and Cursor, which will streamline collaboration and code consistency.
*   The optional cryptocurrency wallet integration relies on the continued availability and support of wallets like Xverse and Magic Eden.
*   The game’s freemium monetization model assumes players value premium in-game content without traditional microtransactions.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **Asset Loading and Performance:**

    *   High-quality 3D assets and advanced visual effects might result in longer load times and performance issues on lower-end devices.
    *   Mitigation: Implement progressive loading, dynamic LOD adjustments, and fallback assets to ensure smooth gameplay.

*   **Wallet Integration Complexity:**

    *   Ensuring a secure and seamless integration with Bitcoin Ordinals wallets can be challenging; handling verification without exposing sensitive data is critical.
    *   Mitigation: Leverage a simple API for wallet connections with proper security protocols, and plan for future updates if wallet providers change their specifications.

*   **Backend Service Reliability:**

    *   Dependence on serverless architectures (like Firebase/AWS Lambda) may lead to operational challenges during peak loads or unforeseen API rate limits.
    *   Mitigation: Implement caching, proper error handling and fallback mechanisms, and routinely test backend services under simulated load.

*   **Cross-Platform Adaptability:**

    *   Achieving a consistent gameplay experience across multiple devices (especially between desktop and mobile) with varying input methods and performance capabilities.
    *   Mitigation: Thorough responsive design, rigorous testing on multiple device types, and an adaptive control system for touch and keyboard inputs.

*   **Cyberpunk Aesthetic Consistency:**

    *   Maintaining a consistent UI style that aligns with the specified cyberpunk theme (neon green, purple accents, glitch animations) across all screens.
    *   Mitigation: Define clear UI component guidelines and style templates early in the design process and incorporate feedback during iterative testing.

This PRD should serve as the single source of truth to guide subsequent technical documents, ensuring all aspects of Cockroach Run's vision, functionality, and technical details are clearly understood and implemented.
