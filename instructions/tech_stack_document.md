# Cockroach Run - Tech Stack Document

This document explains our technology choices for the immersive 3D web-based game, Cockroach Run. Written in everyday language, it explains every important decision in our tech stack, from rendering the game’s beautiful visuals to ensuring smooth gameplay and reliable backend services.

## Frontend Technologies

Our frontend is what the player sees and interacts with – from the loading screen to the in-game HUD. Here's what we use and why:

*   **Three.js & WebGL**

    *   These tools power the detailed 3D graphics and environments, allowing us to create immersive kitchens, sewers, and cyberpunk cityscapes with neon accents.

*   **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**

    *   The core building blocks of our web-based game. They manage everything from our custom UI (menus, loading screens, and game controls) to animations and interactions.

*   **Tailwind CSS**

    *   A utility-first CSS framework that speeds up UI styling. It helps us create a consistent, sleek cyberpunk look with neon green and purple accents.

*   **Custom UI Framework**

    *   Built using a blend of HTML/CSS and JavaScript, this framework drives our intuitive navigation. It's designed to look modern and matches our futuristic game theme.

*   **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**

    *   Used for smooth and engaging animations, GSAP ensures transitions (like glitch effects and neon glows) are fluid and visually appealing.

*   **Lottie**

    *   Integrates complex animations within the UI, giving us an extra layer of polish for the cyberpunk vibe.

*   **React Three Fiber**

    *   This helps bridge UI components with our 3D scene, providing a clean way to manage interactions between the game’s interface and its 3D world.

## Backend Technologies

The backend handles data, game state management, and communications that make premium features work. Here's what we have:

*   **Serverless Architecture (Firebase / AWS Lambda)**

    *   These services power lightweight backend functions such as leaderboard tracking, achievement verification, and game analytics. They ensure scalability while keeping maintenance minimal.

*   **APIs for Wallet and NFT Verification**

    *   Our custom APIs securely verify a player's Bitcoin Ordinals wallet connection. This unlocks premium content (like exclusive characters and game modes) without compromising performance or security.

*   **Databases**

    *   We use cloud-based storage to persist user data (like high scores and unlocked features). Local Storage in the browser also keeps core game progress for users who prefer not to connect a wallet.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

Reliable hosting and continuous updates are essential for smooth player experiences. Our infrastructure includes:

*   **Hosting Platforms (Netlify / Vercel)**

    *   These platforms host our game and ensure rapid deployment. They make sure assets load quickly via global Content Delivery Networks (CDNs).

*   **CI/CD Pipelines**

    *   Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment tools help us deliver updates steadily, ensuring that new features and fixes reach players without disruption.

*   **Version Control Systems**

    *   Tools like Git (managed through IDEs such as VS Code and Cursor) allow our team to collaborate efficiently, keeping track of all changes safely.

## Third-Party Integrations

We integrate several third-party tools that enhance the game’s functionality and overall experience:

*   **Cannon.js**

    *   Provides advanced physics simulations for realistic character movements and interactions.

*   **Howler.js**

    *   Manages audio playback, controls volume, and handles spatial sound to create an immersive audio experience tuned to the cyberpunk theme.

*   **Socket.io**

    *   Prepares our system for future multiplayer or community features, ensuring robust real-time communications if needed.

*   **Discord API**

    *   Enables community engagement by linking game achievements and social features directly with Discord channels.

*   **Web Workers**

    *   Offload intensive tasks from the main game thread to keep the game running smoothly even under heavy load.

## Security and Performance Considerations

Securing user data and ensuring smooth gameplay is crucial. Here's how we handle both:

*   **Security Measures**

    *   Secure API connections are in place for wallet and NFT verification to ensure only authorized users can access premium content.
    *   Proper authentication and rate-limiting ensure that our backend services are safe from abuse.
    *   Data is stored safely, with local and cloud-based options protecting user progress and personal data.

*   **Performance Optimizations**

    *   Progressive asset loading from a global CDN minimizes wait times and keeps gameplay uninterrupted.
    *   Adaptive performance techniques like dynamic Level of Detail (LOD) adjustments ensure that the game maintains smooth frame rates on both high-end and lower-tier devices.
    *   Efficient audio and animation management (using Howler.js and GSAP) makes sure that even complex effects don’t slow the game down.

## Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

The technology choices for Cockroach Run are carefully selected to deliver an exciting, fast, and secure gaming experience:

*   We use cutting-edge 3D rendering with Three.js and WebGL to create immersive, visually stunning environments.
*   Our frontend is built with familiar web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS) paired with modern animation tools like GSAP and Lottie, ensuring a seamless, futuristic UI.
*   A robust serverless backend (leveraging Firebase and AWS Lambda) underpins essential features like user progress, leaderboards, and secure wallet verification.
*   Our hosting and deployment infrastructure, maintained via platforms like Netlify and Vercel, ensures fast, reliable access to the game globally.
*   Third-party tools such as Cannon.js, Howler.js, Socket.io, and Discord API provide additional layers of functionality, enhancing both realism and social connectivity.

Overall, this tech stack not only meets the diverse functional requirements of Cockroach Run but also ensures players have a secure, fluid, and engaging experience across any device. Our aim is to blend state-of-the-art technology with a captivating cyberpunk aesthetic, making every play session as impressive as it is immersive.
