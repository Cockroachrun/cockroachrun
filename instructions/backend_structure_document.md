# Backend Structure Document

This document outlines the backend architecture and infrastructure for the "Cockroach Run" game. It explains how our serverless system is organized along with the databases, API design, hosting, and security, making it easy to understand without needing too much technical background.

## Backend Architecture

The backend follows a serverless model that helps us scale easily and keeps all components cleanly separated. Some key points:

*   Uses a serverless framework (Firebase Functions or AWS Lambda) to run backend logic without managing full servers.
*   Modular design separating game-specific features like leaderboards, wallet verification, achievement tracking, and analytics.
*   API endpoints are built using a RESTful approach, ensuring clean communication between the game (frontend) and the backend.
*   Designed to be scalable and maintainable, meaning as we add features (like new game modes or community functions), we won’t need to change the entire system.
*   Utilizes popular frameworks and libraries in a way that keeps performance high and development agile.

## Database Management

For storing data, we use cloud-based NoSQL solutions – likely Firebase Cloud Firestore or a similar serverless database – which provides:

*   **Data Types in Use:** NoSQL document storage to support the fast retrieval and flexible structure of game data.

*   **Data Handled Includes:**

    *   Global and friend-based leaderboards
    *   User profiles (including wallet-based profiles)
    *   Achievement and progress tracking
    *   Anonymous gameplay analytics

*   **Management Practices:**

    *   Data is updated and retrieved quickly through API calls.
    *   Collections are organized for each type of data, making access efficient and simple.
    *   Security rules and access controls are applied to protect user data.

## Database Schema

Since we use a NoSQL approach, here’s a human-readable view of how data is structured:

*   **Collections & Documents:**

    *   **Users Collection:**

        *   Documents represent each user profile.
        *   Fields include userID, walletID (if connected), progress (game scores, unlocked items), and settings.

    *   **Leaderboard Collection:**

        *   Documents for global scores and friend-based scores.
        *   Fields include userID, score, game mode, and timestamp.

    *   **Achievements Collection:**

        *   Documents for each achievement unlocked by players.
        *   Fields include achievementID, userID, achievement details, and timestamp.

    *   **Analytics Collection:**

        *   Stores anonymous gameplay statistics.
        *   Fields include event type, timestamp, and relevant metadata (like session durations, errors, etc.).

    *   **Ordinals Verification Collection:**

        *   Documents that store verification records from Bitcoin Ordinals wallet checks.
        *   Fields include verificationID, wallet address, status, and related metadata.

## API Design and Endpoints

Our backend APIs are designed following RESTful principles. Here’s how they’re structured:

*   **Design Features:**

    *   Clear separation of operations (GET, POST, etc.)
    *   Consistent responses to facilitate integration with the frontend
    *   Easily extendable for future features (like real-time updates or additional integrations)

*   **Key Endpoints:**

    *   **/api/leaderboard**

        *   GET: Retrieve current global or friend-based leaderboards.
        *   POST: Submit a new score.

    *   **/api/verification**

        *   POST: Verify Bitcoin Ordinals wallet ownership (supports Xverse and Magic Eden wallets).

    *   **/api/achievements**

        *   GET: Retrieve user achievements.
        *   POST: Record a new achievement upon milestone completion.

    *   **/api/analytics**

        *   POST: Collect anonymous gameplay stats for performance and engagement analysis.

    *   **/api/community** (Planned future integration for Discord API and other social features)

## Hosting Solutions

The backend is hosted in a modern cloud environment that provides both reliability and scalability:

*   **Primary Hosting Platforms:**

    *   Frontend is deployed on Vercel or Netlify for fast content delivery.
    *   Backend serverless functions are run via Firebase Functions or AWS Lambda.

*   **Benefits:**

    *   **Reliability:** Cloud providers ensure high uptimes and manage server health automatically.
    *   **Scalability:** Serverless architecture automatically scales up during peak usage and scales down when needed, optimizing costs.
    *   **Cost-Effectiveness:** Pay only for what is used, reducing overhead and resource wastage.

## Infrastructure Components

The backend leverages several supporting components to ensure smooth performance:

*   **Load Balancers:** Managed by the cloud provider, they distribute incoming API traffic to ensure high availability.
*   **Caching Mechanisms:** Integrated caching (browser caches and potentially edge caching) to speed up asset delivery along with API responses.
*   **Content Delivery Network (CDN):** Static assets (like 3D models, textures, and audio files) are served via a CDN, reducing latency especially for users far from the hosting data centers.
*   **Serverless Execution Environment:** Handles the backend logic without the need for a dedicated server, which simplifies maintenance and scaling.

## Security Measures

Security is a top priority in our backend design. Steps taken include:

*   **Authentication & Authorization:**

    *   Secure endpoints through token-based authentication (JWT or similar).
    *   Wallet integration checks are performed securely without requiring a transaction, using cryptographic validation tools.

*   **Data Encryption:**

    *   Sensitive data transmissions are protected via HTTPS and encryption.
    *   Database security rules ensure that only authorized access is allowed.

*   **Regular Audits:**

    *   Automated tests and checks (using Jest/Playwright) help verify that security is maintained.
    *   Monitoring for unusual activity and potential breaches.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

To keep the backend healthy and running smoothly:

*   **Monitoring Tools:**

    *   Cloud provider logging and performance monitoring systems to track API usage and server health.
    *   Error tracking systems to quickly identify and resolve issues.

*   **Maintenance Practices:**

    *   Regular reviews and updates of serverless functions and database rules.
    *   Automated testing and continuous integration to catch issues early.
    *   Scheduled updates and security audits to maintain compliance with best practices.

## Conclusion and Overall Backend Summary

The backend for "Cockroach Run" is designed to be fast, flexible, and secure. Summarizing key points:

*   Employs a serverless architecture on trusted cloud platforms (Firebase Functions or AWS Lambda), ensuring scalability and simple maintenance.
*   Uses a NoSQL database (such as Firebase Firestore) to store player profiles, leaderboards, achievements, and analytics data in a flexible and secure way.
*   Provides well-defined RESTful API endpoints that handle everything from wallet verification to analytics reporting.
*   Hosted on Vercel/Netlify with additional infrastructure layers like CDNs and load balancers to optimize speed and uptime.
